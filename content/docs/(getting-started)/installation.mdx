Ready to dive in? Great! Because we're not here to waste your time with endless setup instructions. A few clicks, a couple of commands, and you're ready to go. It's like IKEA furniture, but without the existential crisis of having extra screws left over.

First things first, let's get Vink into your project. It's like adopting a pet, but this one won't eat your code (we hope).

### Setting Up shadcn/ui

Now, here's where the magic happens. We're using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for our components because, let's face it, they're the real MVPs of the UI world. We're not reinventing the wheel here â€“ we're just making it roll smoother.

1. First, initialize shadcn in your project (if you haven't already). Choose your weapon of choice:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="yarn">yarn</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="bun">bun</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx --bun shadcn@latest init
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

When prompted, choose your preferences. We recommend:
- Style: Default
- Base color: Slate
- CSS variables: Yes
- Tailwind CSS: Yes
- Components directory: @/components
- Utils directory: @/lib/utils

We keep it simple with sensible defaults, but feel free to customize if you're feeling fancy!

2. Now, let's add some components. Here's a starter pack (choose your package manager):

<Tabs defaultValue="npm">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="yarn">yarn</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="bun">bun</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest add button
    npx shadcn@latest add card
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn dlx shadcn@latest add button
    yarn dlx shadcn@latest add card
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add card
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx shadcn@latest add button
    bunx shadcn@latest add card
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Next Steps

Now that you've got everything set up, you can:
1. Start using Vink's utility functions
2. Customize your shadcn components
3. Build something amazing
4. And do whatever you want! (We're not your parents, after all ðŸ˜‰)

Remember: With great power comes great responsibility (and probably some debugging). But don't worry, we've got your back.

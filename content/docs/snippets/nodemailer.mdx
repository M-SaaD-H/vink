title: Advanced Nodemailer Setup
---

import { InstallationCommand } from '../../components/InstallationCommand.tsx'

Because sending emails shouldn't be as complicated as rocket science. Unless you're sending emails to Mars.
## Installation
<InstallationCommand component={'nodemailer-setup'} />

## What's Included?

A robust Nodemailer setup that handles all the email-sending complexities so you don't have to. It's like having a personal email butler, but without the fancy uniform.

### Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Because spamming is so 1999
- **Retry Mechanism**: For when the first try doesn't work (and the second, and the third...)
- **Gmail Integration**: Because who doesn't love Gmail? (Except for the spam folder)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support (because we're not savages)

## Usage

1. Create your email templates using one of these approaches:
   - Write a function that returns HTML (similar to React components)
   - Use plain text strings for simple messages
   - Leverage React Email Templates for more complex designs
2. Import and use your template in the email service configuration
3. Configure your email settings and you're ready to send professional, well-formatted emails

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
REDIRECT_URI=your-redirect-uri
REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
SENDERS_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
ORGANIZATION_NAME=your-orgs-name
```

### Dependencies

This setup includes:
- `nodemailer`: The email-sending library that makes your life easier
- `googleapis`: For Gmail OAuth2 authentication (because security is cool)
- `@types/nodemailer`: Because TypeScript is life

## Best Practices

1. **Rate Limiting**: Don't be that person who gets their email account suspended
2. **Retry Logic**: Because sometimes the first try isn't the charm
3. **Error Handling**: Catch those errors before they catch you
4. **Security**: Keep those credentials safe (or don't, we're not your mom)

## Why Use This?

- **Reliability**: Because losing emails is so 2000s
- **Security**: OAuth2 authentication (because passwords are so last century)
- **Performance**: Rate limiting and connection pooling
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript support and clear error messages

## Common Use Cases

- **Welcome Emails**: Because first impressions matter
- **Password Resets**: For when users forget their passwords (which is always)
- **Notifications**: Because users love getting spammed (they don't)
- **Marketing**: For when you want to test how fast users can click "Unsubscribe"

Remember: A good email setup is like a good friend - it's there when you need it, and it doesn't spam you with cat videos! ðŸ“§

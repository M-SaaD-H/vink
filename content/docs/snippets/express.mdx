title: Express Setup
---

import { InstallationCommand } from '../../components/InstallationCommand.tsx'

Because starting a new Express project shouldn't feel like reinventing the wheel. Unless you're into that kind of thing.
## Installation
<InstallationCommand component={'express-setup'} />

## What's Included?

A battle-tested Express setup that includes all the middleware you'll actually need (and none of the ones you won't). Think of it as a pre-configured Express app that's ready to handle your API requests faster than you can say "middleware".

### Features

- **CORS Configuration**: Because we're not savages who let anyone access our API
- **Body Parsing**: For when your frontend sends more than just "Hello World"
- **Static File Serving**: For serving those assets that make your app look pretty
- **Cookie Parsing**: Because cookies are not just for eating (though we won't judge if you are)

## Usage

```tsx
// app.ts
import express, { Express } from 'express'
import cors from 'cors'
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser'

const app: Express = express();

// Configure CORS middleware
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
  credentials: true
}));

// JSON body parser middleware
app.use(express.json({limit: '16kb'}));

// URL-encoded body parser middleware
app.use(express.urlencoded({
  extended: true,
  limit: '16kb'
}));

// Static file serving middleware
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Cookie parser middleware
app.use(cookieParser());

// Your routes go here
// app.use('/api/v1/users', userRouter);

export { app }
```

```tsx
// index.ts
import { app } from './app'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'

dotenv.config()

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`)
})
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

### Dependencies

This setup includes:
- `express`: The web framework that makes Node.js actually useful
- `cors`: For when you need to share your API with the world (or at least your frontend)
- `cookie-parser`: Because parsing cookies manually is about as fun as debugging production issues
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables (because hardcoding is so 2010)

## Best Practices

1. **Security First**: Always configure CORS properly (unless you enjoy security breaches)
2. **Body Limits**: Keep those request bodies in check (16kb is usually enough for anyone)
3. **Environment Variables**: Use them, love them, never hardcode them
4. **Static Files**: Keep your public assets organized (your future self will thank you)

## Why Use This?

- **Time Saving**: Because life's too short to configure Express from scratch
- **Best Practices**: Includes all the middleware you actually need
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support (because we're not animals)
- **Production Ready**: Configured with security and performance in mind

Remember: A well-configured Express app is like a good cup of coffee - it makes everything else better! â˜•
